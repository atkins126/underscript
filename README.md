# Underscript

Underscript is a Lua extension library that allows you to **run a variety of scripting languages from within Lua scripts**. Underscript's scripted operations can be isolated or "connected" with the variables from the Lua state of the host. 

Currently JavaScript, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, TCL and VBScript are supported.

```lua
require "Underscript"

-- Function Example using PHP
function crc16(s) _script.php
 [[
   $crc = 0xFFFF; 
   for ($x = 0; $x < strlen ($s); $x++) { 
     $crc = $crc ^ ord($s[$x]); 
     for ($y = 0; $y < 8; $y++) { 
       if (($crc & 0x0001) == 0x0001) { 
         $crc = (($crc >> 1) ^ 0xA001); 
       } else { $crc = $crc >> 1; } 
     } 
   } 
   $s = $crc; 
 ]]
 return s
end

-- Simple Hello World Example using PHP
function echo(s) _script.php
 [[
 echo($s);
 ]]
end
```

All local Lua variables (string, number, boolean and nil) are
automatically made accessible from within the code just like if they were part of the Lua script that is running it, as shown in the examples above. If you prefer, connected variables can be disabled or enabled, including for global variables (see **/docs/options.md**)

**Case Sensitiveness in Pascal and VBScript** - PascalScript and VBScript are case-insensitive. When using them avoid using Lua variables with the same name but different case.

## Compiling

For compiling Underscript, you will need [Catarinka](https://github.com/felipedaragon/catarinka) and [pLua](https://github.com/felipedaragon/pLua-XE).
 
There is no need to install third-party components in the IDE - you can just add the dependencies listed above to the library path and hit compile. It currently compiles under Delphi XE10 Tokyo or up.

We also would love to see a C port of this library.
