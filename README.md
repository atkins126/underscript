# Underscript Lua Extensions

Underscript is a ninja Lua extension library that extends Lua to:

* **Run a wide variety of scripting languages from within Lua scripts** through the _script function. The script can use the variables from the Lua script as it was part of itself. All kinds of scripting languages are supported, including various versions of Lua itself - allowing to run for example a LuaJIT from within standard Lua. The _script method is expanding and evolving.
* **Cross-language import** a library through requirex functions (still limited and evolving). This allows for example to require a JavaScript file like it was a Lua script and then use its functions.
* **Run 32-bit Lua on Lua 64-bit** through the require32 function. This LoL (Lua on Lua) system allows to load and use legacy 32-bit Lua DLLs and libraries from within a 64-bit Lua application (still beta and evolving). 

## Examples

### LoL (Lua 32-bit on Lua 64-bit)
```lua
require "luaonlua"
uuid = require32("uuid") -- imports the 32-bit uuid.dll
print(uuid.new())
m = require32("math") -- imports the math library from Lua 32-bit
print(m.sqrt(1234))
print(type(m.sqrt(1234)))
print(m.pi)
```

This is possible under Windows systems thanks to WoW64, the subsystem of Windows capable of running 32-bit applications on 64-bit Windows. 

LoL when compiled to 32-bit also allows you to run 64-bit Lua on Lua 32-bit through the require64 function, but it has not been tested yet.

### Cross-Language Import

```lua
require "Underscript"
test = requirex.js("test") -- Loads test.js
test.hello()
print(test.aloha("Lua"))
```

test.js:
```javascript
var test = { 
    hello: function () { 
        UConsole.WriteLn("Hello World");              
    },
    aloha: function (name) { 
        return "Aloha, "+name+"!";             
    }            
} 
```

### Run Script

```lua
require "Underscript"

-- Function Example using PHP
function crc16(s) _script.php
 [[
   $crc = 0xFFFF; 
   for ($x = 0; $x < strlen ($s); $x++) { 
     $crc = $crc ^ ord($s[$x]); 
     for ($y = 0; $y < 8; $y++) { 
       if (($crc & 0x0001) == 0x0001) { 
         $crc = (($crc >> 1) ^ 0xA001); 
       } else { $crc = $crc >> 1; } 
     } 
   } 
   $s = $crc; 
 ]]
 return s
end

-- Simple Hello World Example using PHP
function echo(s) _script.php
 [[
 echo($s);
 ]]
end
```

All local Lua variables (string, number, boolean and nil) are
automatically made accessible from within the code just like if they were part of the Lua script that is running it, as shown in the examples above. If you prefer, connected variables can be disabled or enabled, including for global variables (see **/docs/options.md**)

## Available Languages and Engines

**Case Sensitiveness in Pascal and VBScript** - PascalScript and VBScript are case-insensitive. When using them avoid using Lua variables with the same name but different case.

## Compiling

For compiling Underscript, you will need [Catarinka](https://github.com/felipedaragon/catarinka) and [pLua](https://github.com/felipedaragon/pLua-XE).
 
There is no need to install third-party components in the IDE - you can just add the dependencies listed above to the library path and hit compile. It currently compiles under Delphi XE10 Tokyo or up.

We also would love to see a C port of this library.
